# cbc_Analyzer
A simple android application to analyze the CBC report parameters before going to the doctor. This is a user assistance application to spreading awareness related to hemoglobin components and issue identification.
I developed the application to focus on a remote area of people who wanted to know information about hemoglobin. Due to a lack of medical awareness, we never care about our health but will test reports at least check.
